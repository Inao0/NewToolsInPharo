# New Tools in Pharo

Welcome to this collaborative book. 
We are looking for contributions to new tools in the Pharo ecosystem.
Here is a non-exhaustive list of possible tools we have in mind. 

- Development tools such as refactoring, memory usage, and new approaches to debugging
- Development tools such as UI builders, 
- Development tools to develop compilers
- Tools for modeling such as Cormas, Moose, 
- Libraries such

Each chapter will be reviewed by three reviewers.

We expect the chapters to 
- describe the tools,
- present some clear scenarios,
- describe key elements of implementations,
- evidence of use of the tools, 

Submission process:
-  A chapter must be written in Microdown. Writers may want to clone the current repository and use Pillar (see [https://github.com/pillar-markup/pillar](https://github.com/pillar-markup/pillar) and [https://github.com/pillar-markup/microdown](https://github.com/pillar-markup/microdown)). The Sample1 folder in the Chapters folder contains a sample chapter. 
- The authors should send an email to stephane.ducasse@inria.fr and goca@dmi.uns.ac.rs
- The authors should then do a PR to this repository with their chapter containing all their files.
- Citations should be expressed using the microdown citation  e.g. {!citation|ref=Blac09a!} using `{!citation|ref=Blac09a!}`,
- A chapter must be spellchecked with a system such as grammarly,
- if needed, each chapter should contain a bibfile having the same name than the main folder file,
- if needed each chapter should contain a folder named 'figures' that contains the figures of the chapter.
	
The Sample1 folder illustrates this structure, it contains:
- `Sample1.bib`
- `Sample1.md`
- `figures/pharo.png`
- `figures/rmod.png`

	
This book will be published via the book-on-demand program of [http://bod.fr](http://bod.fr). 
It will be published on the Bibliotheque Nationale de France and it will be available on most public platforms such as amazon.com.
