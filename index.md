# New Tools in Pharo

Welcome to this collaborative book. 
We are looking for contributions to new tools in the Pharo ecosystem.
Here is a non-exhaustive list of possible tools we have in mind. 

- Development tools such as refactoring, memory usage, and new approaches to debugging
- Development tools such as UI builders, 
- Development tools to develop compilers
- Tools for modeling such as Cormas, Moose, 
- Libraries such

Each chapter will be reviewed by three reviewers.

We expect the chapters to 
- describe the tools,
- present some clear scenarios,
- describe key elements of implementations,
- evidence of use of the tools, 

Submission process:
	- a chapter should be written in microdown. Writers may want to clone the current repository and use Pillar (see https://github.com/pillar-markup/pillar and https://github.com/pillar-markup/microdown).
	- citation of scientific articles should be expressed using the microdown citation e.g. `<!citation|key=Duca99a!>`,
	- have been spellchecked with a system such as grammarly,
	- each chapter should contain a bibfile having the same name than the main.md file,
	- each chapter should contain a folder named figures that contains the figures of the chapter.
	
This book will be published via the book-on-demand program of http://bod.fr.
