Welcome to this collaborative book. 
We are looking for contributions to new tools in the Pharo ecosystem.
Here is a non-exhaustive list of possible tools we have in mind. 

- Development tools such as refactoring, memory usage, and new approaches to debugging
- Development tools such as UI builders
- Development tools to develop compilers
- Tools for modeling such as Cormas, Moose
- Libraries as basis for advanced tools

Each chapter will be reviewed by three reviewers.

We expect the chapters to 
- describe the tools,
- present some clear scenarios,
- describe key elements of implementations,
- evidence of use of the tools, 

Submission process:
-  A chapter must be written in Microdown. Writers may want to clone the current repository and use Pillar (see [https://github.com/pillar-markup/pillar](https://github.com/pillar-markup/pillar) and [https://github.com/pillar-markup/microdown](https://github.com/pillar-markup/microdown)). The Sample1 folder in the Chapters folder contains a sample chapter.
- The authors should send an email to stephane.ducasse@inria.fr, goca@dmi.uns.ac.rs, and juanpablo.sandoval@uc.cl.
- The authors should then do a PR to this repository with their chapter containing all their files.


-  The length of each chapter is not fixed but authors should make sure that the chapter is not either too short or too long. It is worth to see that the format is good for tutorials but is not compact. We will give feedback on this aspect.
-  As usual the material should be new and unpublished. 
- Citations should be expressed using the microdown citation  e.g. {!citation|ref=Blac09a!} using `{!citation|ref=Blac09a!}`,
- A chapter must be spellchecked with a system such as grammarly,
- if needed, each chapter should contain a bibfile having the same name than the main folder file,
- if needed each chapter should contain a folder named 'figures' that contains the figures of the chapter.
	
The Sample1 folder illustrates this structure, it contains:
- `Sample1.bib`
- `Sample1.md`
- `figures/pharo.png`
- `figures/rmod.png`

	
This book will be published via the book-on-demand program of [http://bod.fr](http://bod.fr). 
It will be published on the Bibliotheque Nationale de France and it will be available on most public platforms such as amazon.com.
